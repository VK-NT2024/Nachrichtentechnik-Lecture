## Linear Block Codes

Class users the library galois which supports a rich set of block codes. 
For teaching purposes, the class BlockCodes only contains quite simple codes like
* Single Parity Check codes
* Repetition codes
* Hamming codes
* Simplex codes

Generator and parity check matrices are created during initialization. Moreover, encoding and 
syndrome decoding are provided. For some codes, also soft-output decoding is available.
